# Repo
optional
Now your GitHub and VS code is connect but not fully. you have to save or add the changes you have made and then commit it. follow me

to save the changes you made you can type git add filename or git add . this space dot will save all the files saved....

still it is not copied in github to do that

now the data has been save + Transfered

you can create new filess too and save + transfer in the same manner.
